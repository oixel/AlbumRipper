# AlbumRipper
A tool designed to easily download albums for portable music players.

## Planning
Currently I am looking towards two different APIs that might allow the streamlining of finding tracklists.
1) [Discog API](https://www.discogs.com/developers)
2) [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)

I am leaning more towards MusicBrainz as it is entirely free and does not require any API keys.
